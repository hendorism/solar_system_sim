# solar_system_sim
Using physics not unlike those found in the game Asteroids, I want to simulate a solar system in html5 DOM. Solar system objects represented by javascript objects represented by DOM objects (circular DIV elements).

This repo was inspired by this coding challenge...

And by this Asteroids tutorial...

Typically one would use html canvas for this type of thiing, but I am interested in manipulating the DOM dynamically in real-time, because this coding challenge has made me aware I suck at that!

The goal is to make a full scale model of our solar system using the known masses, densities, and orbital characteristics of all the major objects in our system, i.e. sun, planets, moons, dwarf planets, and major asteroids.
